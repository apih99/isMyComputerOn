# IS MY COMPUTER ON (OFFICIAL REAL)

## THE GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR TIME

Have you ever looked at your glowing monitor and thought to yourself, is this thing actually working? Or am I just hallucinating?

Worry no more. We have deployed state of the art quantum algorithms to determine the binary state of your machine.

### WHY THIS EXISTS

Because the world needed to know.
Also I was bored.

### FEATURES

+   Instant Verification: We check if true equals true. It is very complex.
+   Blazingly Fast: Faster than your attention span.
+   Advanced UI: Colors that go brrr.
+   Diagnostics: Fake graphs that look important.

### HOW TO RUN THIS MASTERPIECE

1.  Clone the repo (CTRL C CTRL V but fancier)
2.  npm install (download the entire node modules black hole)
3.  npm run dev (let him cook)

### TECH STACK

+   React: Because jQuery is for boomers.
+   Tailwind: CSS but for people who hate CSS.
+   Vite: Fast. Very fast.

### CONTRIBUTING

If you break it, you buy it.
PRs welcome but only if they make the code worse or funnier.

### LICENSE

Do whatever you want. I am not a lawyer.
